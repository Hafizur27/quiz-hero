    <h3 class="text-center text-3xl my-10">3. What is event loop and how does work event loop ?</h3>
    <p class="w-9/12 mx-auto mb-10">The event loop is a mechanism used in many programming languages, including JavaScript, to handle asynchronous operations and non-blocking I/O. It is a continuous process that enables an application to respond to multiple events simultaneously without blocking the main thread or freezing the user interface. <br> In JavaScript, the event loop operates by continuously monitoring two queues: the call stack and the task queue. When the call stack is empty, the event loop checks the task queue for any pending tasks that can be executed. If there are any pending tasks, the event loop moves them from the task queue to the call stack, and the JavaScript engine executes them one by one. <br> If a pending task involves an asynchronous operation, such as a network request or a timer, it is scheduled to run in the background by the runtime environment, and the JavaScript engine continues executing other tasks from the call stack. When the asynchronous operation is completed, the runtime environment adds the corresponding callback function to the task queue. <br>The event loop processes the task queue and executes the callback function, updating the state of the application or triggering new asynchronous operations. The event loop also has a microtask queue, which is a separate queue that holds small and fast-running tasks, such as promises or process.nextTick() callbacks. The microtask queue is processed before the task queue, ensuring that these high-priority tasks are executed as soon as possible. </p>
