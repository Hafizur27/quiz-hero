    <article>
        <h3 class="text-center text-3xl my-10 bg-green-300 text-gray-800 w-9/12 mx-auto">1. what is the difference between map(),<br>  filter(), forEach() & find() methods ?</h3>
        <p class="w-9/12 mx-auto mb-10"><span class="text-xl font-bold"> map() :- </span> map method returns a new array with the same length as the original array, where each element is transformed by the callback function passed as an argument. The original array is not modified. <br> Example: <br> const Array = [1, 2, 3]; <br> const newArray = Array.map(element => element * 2); <br> console.log(newArray); <br>newArray: [2, 4, 6]</p>

        <p class="w-9/12 mx-auto mb-10"><span class="text-xl font-bold">filter() :- </span> filter method  returns a new array with some or all of the elements of the original array, depending on whether they pass a test specified by the callback function. The original array is not modified. <br> Example: <br> const Array = [1, 2, 4]; <br> const newArray = Array.filter(element => element % 2 === 0); <br> console.log(newArray); <br>newArray: [2, 4]</p>

        <p class="w-9/12 mx-auto mb-10"><span class="text-xl font-bold">forEach() :- </span> forEach method executes a provided function once for each array element, but it doesn't return anything. It's mainly used for performing side effects on each element of the array. <br> Example: <br> const Array = [1, 2]; <br>Array.forEach(element => console.log(element)); <br> firstElement: 1<br>secondElement: 2</p>

        <p class="w-9/12 mx-auto mb-10"><span class="text-xl font-bold">find() :- </span> find method returns the first element in the array that satisfies a specified test provided by the callback function. If no element satisfies the test, undefined is returned. <br> Example: <br> const Array = [1, 2, 3]; <br> const newValue = Array.find(element => element === 2);<br> console.log(newValue); <br>newValue: 2</p>

      <h3 class="text-center text-3xl my-10 bg-green-300 text-gray-800 w-9/12 mx-auto">2. What is the difference between <br> local storage, session storage & cookies ?</h3>
      <p class="w-9/12 mx-auto mb-10"><span class="text-xl font-bold">Local Storage :- </span> localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is closed. The client  can only read local storage. There is no transfer of data to the server.The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB.As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually.</p>
      <p class="w-9/12 mx-auto mb-10"><span class="text-xl font-bold">session Storage :- </span>Session storage allows you to store data in the browser depending on the system memory and the data stored in the browser until the browser is closed. In other words, closing the browser will clear all the data stored in session storage. The client  can only read session storage.There is no transfer of data to the server. The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB. It's session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session.</p>
      <p class="w-9/12 mx-auto mb-10"><span class="text-xl font-bold">Cookies :- </span>A cookie is an amount of information that persists between a server-side and a client-side. A web browser stores this information at the time of browsing. A cookie contains the information as a string generally in the form of a name-value pair separated by semi-colons. Both clients and servers can read and write the cookies. Data transfer to the server is exist. The storage capacity of Cookies is 4KB. Cookies expire based on the setting and working per tab and window.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center text-3xl my-10 bg-green-300 text-gray-800 w-9/12 mx-auto">3. What is event loop and how does work it?</h3>
    <p class="w-9/12 mx-auto mb-10">The event loop is a mechanism used in many programming languages, including JavaScript, to handle asynchronous operations and non-blocking I/O. It is a continuous process that enables an application to respond to multiple events simultaneously without blocking the main thread or freezing the user interface. <br> In JavaScript, the event loop operates by continuously monitoring two queues: the call stack and the task queue. When the call stack is empty, the event loop checks the task queue for any pending tasks that can be executed. If there are any pending tasks, the event loop moves them from the task queue to the call stack, and the JavaScript engine executes them one by one. <br> If a pending task involves an asynchronous operation, such as a network request or a timer, it is scheduled to run in the background by the runtime environment, and the JavaScript engine continues executing other tasks from the call stack. When the asynchronous operation is completed, the runtime environment adds the corresponding callback function to the task queue. <br>The event loop processes the task queue and executes the callback function, updating the state of the application or triggering new asynchronous operations. The event loop also has a microtask queue, which is a separate queue that holds small and fast-running tasks, such as promises or process.nextTick() callbacks. The microtask queue is processed before the task queue, ensuring that these high-priority tasks are executed as soon as possible. </p>

  <p class="w-9/12 mx-auto mb-10">Here "quizTimer" is a function, this function used for set time for quiz. it has one parameter "dismiss", which is indicating boolean value whether to stop timer or start timer. if the "dismiss" contain true value , we called "clearInterval" method to stop the timer and return from the function. and if "dismiss" value is false we called "setInterval" method for set timer that executes a callback function every 1 second.Inside the callback function, the current count is displayed on the webpage, and the count is incremented by 1 second. The if statement checks whether the count has exceeded 60 seconds, and if it has, the classList property of the countHtml element is updated to alternate between two different CSS classes (text-red-300 and text-red-700) every 2 seconds</p>

  <h3 class="text-center text-3xl my-10 bg-green-300 text-gray-800 w-9/12 mx-auto">5. What is the definition chooseQuiz() function ?</h3>
  <p class="w-9/12 mx-auto mb-10">Here chooseQuiz() function takes two parameters "index" and "givenAns". it is update the "answers" array with the selected answer. The "find" method is used to check if an answer already exists for the quiz with the specified index in the answers array. The find method returns the first element in the array that satisfies the given condition, which is whether the id property of the answer object matches the id property of the quiz object at the specified index in quizData. If an answer already exists for the quiz, the splice method is used to replace the existing answer object with a new object that has the same properties as the quiz object, except for the givenAns property, which is set to the value of the givenAns parameter. If an answer does not exist for the quiz, a new answer object is created by using the spread operator to copy the properties of the quiz object, and the givenAns property is set to the value of the givenAns parameter. The new answer object is then added to the end of the answers array using the push method. Finally, the displayAnswers function is called with the updated answers array as an argument, which updates the UI to display the selected answer for each quiz. </p>
